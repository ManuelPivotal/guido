# Files in this directory are used to configure guido on an per-environment basis
# 
# Files are named {env}.conf where env is the name of the environment for which the configuration is applied
# 
# As soon as files are commited the guido agent in the environment reads the changes from git and applies them
#
# The format is as follows
#    {class-name-ant-path}=[threshold:v,switch-value
#    where:
#       class name - specifies the pattern for the classnames to be logged
#       v - threshold below which no logging will take place.
#           v is expressed in ms, can be a decimal (0.1, 0.5 or 10000),
#           default threshold is 0.5 ms unless the default is specified using -Dguido.threshold=v as a startup parameter
#       switch-value - turns logging for this class on or off
#

# The Ant style matching:
#    ? matches one character
#    * matches zero or more characters
#    ** matches zero or more 'directories' in a path
# 
#    Some examples:
#    
#    com.vocado.t?st.jsp - matches com.vocado.test but also com.vocado.tast or com.vocado.txst
#    com.vocado.* - matches all classes that are directly in the com.vocado package
#    com.vocado.** - matches all classes that are in the com.vocado package or package that starts with com.vocado
#    com.vocado.**.Test - matches all Test classes wherever they are defined as long as the package starts with com.vocado 

# Examples
# this will log everything
# **=on,threshold:0

# logs only vocado methods regardless of duration
# **.vocado.**=on,threshold:0

# logs only hazelcast methods where the duration is greater than the default threshold of 0.5ms
# **.hazelcast.**=on

# logs only tomcat methods
# **.tomcat.**=on

# logs all classes inheriting from java.sql interfaces, whatever is the time spent in the method
# java.sql.**=threshold:0,on
